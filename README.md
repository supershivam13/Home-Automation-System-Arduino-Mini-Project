## üìå Introduction

We are living in the 21st century where automation of any form i.e. home or industrial plays an important role in human life. When it comes to industrial automation, the concept is applied to large machines or robots which helps in increasing the efficiency in terms of production, energy and time.
Home automation on the other hand involves automating the household environment. This is possible because of the smartphones and internet that we are widely using. Home automation can be again divided into just controlling the appliances using a smartphone from a remote location and another type filled with sensors and actuators which controls the lighting, temperature, door locks, electronic gadgets, electrical appliances etc. using a ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù system.


## In this project, we will design a simple home automation project using simple components using which different electrical appliances can switched on or off. The project is based on Arduino and we have used Arduino UNO for the project.
